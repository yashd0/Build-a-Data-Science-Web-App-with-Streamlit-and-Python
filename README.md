# Project Overview
* This project aims to guide you in building a data science web application using the Streamlit library in Python. The goal is to transform simple Python scripts into interactive web apps without requiring prior web development experience. By following the steps outlined in this project, you will learn how to load, explore, visualize, and interact with data, ultimately generating dashboards with less than 100 lines of Python code

# Prerequisites
* Python (version X.X.X)
Streamlit (version X.X.X)
Pandas (version X.X.X)
Plotly (version X.X.X)
Numpy (version X.X.X)
... (other dependencies)


  # Conclusion
  * By leveraging Python and Streamlit, you can now create interactive web apps without the need for extensive web development knowledge. You can use these skills to showcase and share your data analysis and machine learning projects with others through visually appealing and user-friendly web interfaces.

Feel free to customize and expand upon the web app according to your specific requirements. Experiment with different datasets, add additional visualizations, or incorporate advanced machine learning models to enhance the functionality and insights provided by your web app.
